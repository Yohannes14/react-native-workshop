cd react-native-fundamentals
npm install
```

## Running the App

With the project installed you can start the project by running `npm start`.



## Exercises

You can find a pre-made file for each exercise in the `exercises` directory. Each exercise has a `.js` file and `.md` file. The `.md` files will give you context about what you're doing and give you the exercise(s). The `.js` file will be where you do your work.

> Important: Make sure you use `export default` from the exercise js file so that the app can pick up your code.

You can find solutions for each exercise in the `solutions` folder (they use the same file name).
